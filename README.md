# Scratch Projects

This repository contains some example programs I've made with the Scratch-programming language.

### BatSoup
My first Scratch animation. I implemented multiple Sprites, created animations by switching between costumes, and executed simple motion commands. 

### Hoops
My first Scratch game. Gameplay involves moving the ball with the arrow keys to the goal 10 times as fast as you can. The highscore tab shows the fastest stored. The timer tab shows you're current time. 

### Snake

This is my version of the classic mobile game, Snake.
The tutroial Snake_veiledning.docx (in norwegian) is till under development.
